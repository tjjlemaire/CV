During my academic I have had the chance to develop strong engineering skills (especially in computing) in parallel to a specialization in the field of Neuroprosthetics. 
I am particularly interested in problems that have both biological and technical complexity, such as those encountered in the fields of neuro-engineering, biorobotics or network modeling, to name but a few.  
I am seeking for a job, either in the academic field or in industry, that would allow me to further develop my engineering skills and to strengthen my knowledge in a new area of expertise. I don't mind travelling and discovering new working cultures.
I am hard-working, persevering, and not afraid to think outside the box and explore new tracks beyond my scope of knowledge. I am also a good listener and enjoy interacting with my colleagues. As for languages I can speak fluent English and French, but I also have full working proficiency in German and some knowledge of Russian.
Besides work, I am a passionate for sports in general, and for skiing in particular. In fact, I am currently in the middle of a formation to pass the French state diploma of ski instructor. This formation is spread over several years and consists of condensed 2-3 weeks trainings interspersed with field-level placements in ski schools. Hence, I have already given private and collective lessons to both adults and kids, beginners and advanced skiers for 4 winters now. I really value this experience as it has taught me a lot on how to manage groups and adapt to each and everyone's difficulties in order to reach concrete objectives collectively.
